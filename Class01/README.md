# Class 01

## We learned about Headings from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

**Paragraphs** are created like this. 
I really like github.
**Don't** put spaces or tabs in front of your paragraph.
# Line Breaks

Line breaks are done.
Line breaks can be done after.<br>
And the next line.

# Bold and Italic
Italicized text goes like *this*.
To bold and italicize put your words like ***this***.
