## Wireframing 

**Wireframing** is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to **process information** on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

When designing the screen, you need to know where all the info will go in **plain black and white** diagrams before building anything with code.

**Wireframing** is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

Without the distractions of **colors, typeface choices or text,** wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface.

## HTML

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 

**HTML** consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 

The **enclosing tags** can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
