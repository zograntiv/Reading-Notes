## Expressions and Operators

An **expression** is a valid unit of code that resloves to a value.

There are two types of expressions, those that that have side effects(such as asssigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

The expression x=7 is an example of the first type. The expression uses the **=** operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evauluates to 7.

THe expression 3+4 is an example of the second type. The expression uses the **+** operator to add **3** and **4** together and produces a value, 7.
