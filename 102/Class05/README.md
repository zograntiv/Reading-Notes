## CSS

**CSS** **(Cascading Style Sheets)** allows you to create great-looking web pages.

**CSS** is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

**CSS** can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links.

It can be used to create a **layout** — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.

CSS is a **rule-based language** — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

CSS properties have different **allowable values**, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the **color property**, which can take various color values. We also have the **font-size property**. This property can take various size units as a value.
