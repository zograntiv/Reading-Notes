## Javascript

**JavaScript** is a lightweight,interpreted, or **just-in-time** complied programming language with first class functions.

**JavaScript** is a **prototype-based**, multi-paradigm, **single-threaded**, **dynamic** language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.

**Prototype-based**: is a style of **object-oriented programming** in which classes are not explicity defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class, or less frequently, adding them to an empty object.

**Object-oriented programming**: is an approach in programming in which data is encapsualted within objects and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.
